Here, among clusters and containers, you shall trace the paths of those who came before You.<br>
***<br>
May your containers build, your clusters reconcile, and your YAML remain untainted by traitorous indentation.<br>
The flame flickers, but it does not fade - not yet!<br>

## 🏴‍☠️ What Is This?
### This is a **1‑on‑1 training ground** for mastering:

- **Docker** — the art of binding your .NET creations into immutable vessels  
- **Kubernetes** — the orchestration of Pods, Deployments, and Services  
- **.NET** — your trusted weapon, reforged to thrive in containerized realms  

#### Each lesson is crafted as a **challenge**, a trial by fire, designed to strengthen your understanding through practice rather than mere observation.

<h2 align="center">☠️ The True Trials Await in the Wiki<h2>
<h3 align="center">Beyond this threshold lies the Wiki, a labyrinth of trials forged in YAML, CLI incantations<br>& the quiet hum of container daemons.</h3>

There, you will:

- Build and tag Docker images  
- Push and pull from registries  
- Deploy .NET services into Kubernetes  
- Face ConfigMaps, Secrets, and Ingresses  
- Wrestle with scaling, health checks, and rolling updates  

<h4 align="center">The Wiki is your safepoint bonfire!<br>Begin your pilgrimage from there.<br>Return to it whenever the cluster grows dark and inscrutable.</h4>
